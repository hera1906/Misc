= Undo some changes in one or more commits: =

*ONLY DO THIS IN A BRANCH. NEVERÂ in a master*

git reset --mixed <commit>     # Make the given commit the latest commit,
                               # All changes after that will be unstaged


git add <something>            # Stage the changes you want to keep
git commit                     # Commit these changes


git push --force origin <branch> (e.g. feature/SXU_1018....)
                               # Force push the changes, the commits
                               # after the reset above will be done
                               # forever
