= Branches =


== List branch ==

    git branch [-a] [-v]                      # List existing branches

== Switch branch ==
    git checkout <branch>                     # Switch to branch (update index and work tree, set HEAD)
                                              # local changes are kept so they can be committed
                                              # -a: Both local and remote branches, -v: Verbose

== Checkout/Clone branch ==

    fetch
    git checkout -t origin/...                # Checkout and track branch that exists on server

    git checkout -B <branch>                  # Create new branch, then check it out
                                              # If branch existed, then reset it

    git checkout -b <branch> origin/<branch>  # Create local branch from remote branch
    git push -u <branch>                      # Track the branch

== Delete branch ==

    git branch -d branchname                  # Delete merged local branch
    git branch -D branchname                  # Delete unmerged local branch

To delete it from the remote in old versions of Git use:
    git push --delete origin branchname       # Delete branch from remote
    git push origin :branchname               # Delete branch from remote (old syntax)

== Prune ==
Once you delete the branch from the remote, you can prune to get rid of remote tracking branches with:
git remote prune origin                       # Prune to get rid of remote tracking branches

    git branch -dr branchname                 # Prune indiviual remote tracking branch
