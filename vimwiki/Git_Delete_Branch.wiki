== Delete branch ==

git branch -d branchname # Delete merged local branch
git branch -D branchname # Delete unmerged local branch

To delete it from the remote in old versions of Git use:
git push --delete origin branchname # Delete branch from remote
git push origin :branchname         # Delete branch from remote (old syntax)

Once you delete the branch from the remote, you can prune to get rid of remote tracking branches with:
git remote prune origin # Prune to get rid of remote tracking branches

git branch -dr branchname # Prune indiviual remote tracking branch
