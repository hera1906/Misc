= Git Concepts =

* We clone a repository to get a local copy.
* A branch is a pointed to a commit
* A branch can be local branch or a remote branch and in order to have a local branch we issue a check-out from the remote branches.
* Local branch is a branch that you have locally in your repository
* Remote branch is a branch that exists on the centralized repository
* Working copy is where we make our changes to a branch
* When we want changes from our fellow colleagues (remote) we use a pull (it’s a fetch then merge)
* When we want changes from our fellow colleagues (remote) without incorporating it in our working copy we issue just a fetch.

*HEAD*: Last commit snapshot
*The Index*: Proposed next commit (e.g. what is staged)
*Working copy*: Sandbox
