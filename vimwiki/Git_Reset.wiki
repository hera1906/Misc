== Reset ==

#1) Move whatever branch HEAD points to (stop if --soft)
#2) THEN, make the Index look like that (stop here unless --hard)
#3) THEN, make the Working Directory look like that

git reset -p                            # Interactive reset, ask about each change
git reset --hard <commit id>            # Revert all changes after this commit
git reset --hard origin/2245_develop    # Revert the revert

git reset <path>                        # Unstage file
