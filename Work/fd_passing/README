server & client:
----------------------------
server without arguments waits for a TCP connection on port 8888, then transfers
this connection to the client

server with argument tries to open the argument as a file, then transfers the
file to the client after having read  it reads 32 bytes from the file.

Usage:
file example:
  server test.txt
  client

socket example:
  server
  telnet 127.0.0.1 8888
  client

  Write something in telnet to see that the descriptor has been transferred
